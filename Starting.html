                <h1>Character Selection</h1>
                <p>Every player character at ETU is a student, but there are as many different types of students as there are characters. Here are some ideas. Fully
                fleshed-out archetypes can be found on <a href="https://www.peginc.com" target="_blank">www.peginc.com</a></p>

        <div class="characters">
                <h2>Activist</h2>
                <p>Conservation, the green movement, PETA, Green Peace, Anti-Nukes, Anti-War - these are your mantras. <strong>Someone has to protect the world for the next
                    generation and it might as well be you.</strong> ETU is a small college, but one involved in agriculture, Homeland Defense, and other biological and nuclear
                    studies types. You can make a difference. You will be heard.

                <p>Whether it's singing, acting, making movies, or some other performance art, <strong>you live for the stage</strong>. ETU is small enough that you can get lots of
                    time in front of an audience. Hopefully by furthering your studies and honing your craft, you'll catch your big break.

                    find your voice.

                <p><strong>You grew up in Pinebox</strong> or the surrounding area. Most of your friends left to find jobs or education in other cities. you know there are dangers inherit
                    to living in Pinebox, but for you it's just a way of life. ETU is a fine school, and you can go home to run laundry whenever you want.

                <h2>Martial Artist</h2>
                <p><strong>You've been taking some form of martial arts since you were little</strong>. You've won a few tournaments and it's part of your life.</p>
                <p>Your training taught you the importance of discipline in body and mind to reach your personal best. you are constantly working out at the local dojo
                    and it helps keep you focused on what you want to achieve.
                </p>

                <h2>Occultist</h2>
                <p>You have always been <strong>fascinated by the idea of arcane secrets and the possibility of a supernatural world</strong> beyond what you can see. You're convinced
                    that you can learn to wield these powers yourself...if only you can find the right teacher. Where will you find the education you seek? ETU seems
                    like a likely choice.

                <h2>ROTC</h2>
                <p>The plan is to graduate with honors in the <strong>Reserve Officer Training Corps program</strong>, then serve a stint in the active military. This helps with the bills
                    and you get to serve your country in the process. Sure, you get a little less freedom and parties than your friends, but the price of liberty is eternal
                    vigilance, after all.
                </p>
                <img src="Photos/ROTC.jfif" alt="ROTC photo" />

                <h2>Scholar</h2>
                <p>The new ETU library is well regarded and many professors seem top-notch. How such a relatively small college can recruit so man renowned professors is a 
                    mystery, but <strong>this school suits your needs</strong> and you eagerly look forward to getting started.
                </p>

                <h2>Sorority Sister</h2>
                <p>Sororities look great on resumes, and you've always liked working with other go-getters like yourself. Your sorority has great parties, but the sisters also
                    <strong>do a lot of good for Pinebox</strong> with constant fundraisers and community service projects.

                <h2>Stranger in a Strange Land</h2>
                <p><strong>You were born in another country</strong> and have come to ETU for an American education. Now you are learning the meaning of the saying 'Texas is like a whole other country.'
                    The people talk with a strange, slow accent, look at strangers oddly, and while they are outwardly friendly, you know there is mistrust and doubt bubbling just below
                    the surface. Can you fit in here? Make friends? Be successful?
                </p>
                <img src="Photos/stranger.jfif" alt="Stranger photo" />

                <h2>Wild Child</h2>
                <p>Yeah, getting accepted to ETU is fine, but mostly you can't wait to get away from home. You're all grown up and ready to experience all the things you've been 
                    missing out on. You're gonna get tattoos and piercings and don't care what anybody thinks. ETU doesn't know what it's in for. <strong>Let's get this party started!</strong>
